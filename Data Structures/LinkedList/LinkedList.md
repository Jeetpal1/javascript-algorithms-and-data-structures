# LinkedIn Data Structure

This section of the repository is dedicated to understanding and implementing data structures commonly encountered in LinkedIn's software developer interviews. The aim is to provide clear, JavaScript-based examples and explanations to help you navigate through the types of data structure problems LinkedIn might present.

## Overview

LinkedIn, being a major player in the tech industry, places a significant emphasis on data structures in its interview process. Mastery of these concepts is crucial for solving complex problems efficiently. Here, we cover the essentials, from basic to advanced data structures, tailored to the expectations of LinkedIn's technical interviews.

## What's Inside

- **Linked Lists**: Explore singly and doubly linked lists, with common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Trees**: Delve into binary trees, binary search trees, and graph-based structures, focusing on operations and algorithms relevant to LinkedIn's problem sets.
- **Hash Tables**: Understand the implementation and use-cases of hash tables, with a focus on handling collisions and optimizing lookup times.
- **Graphs**: Get to grips with graph representations, traversals, and algorithms that are frequently tested in interviews.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain a deep understanding of each data structure and its applications.
- Solve problems efficiently using the appropriate data structures.
- Write clean, efficient, and scalable JavaScript code for complex data structures.
